# VitalizeProject
Master branch - pushed from origin

# Possible Bugs
1. Transition from non-Me tabs to logout (there's a unsmooth transition)
2. Configuring firebase backend: need to open project on Xcode to configure firebase but right now they are separate projects. Need to make .xcodeproj file match that of the Vitalize_App_Official file ( Helpful links: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7pkSP18Oko , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44341559/cocoapods-no-xcode-project-found-please-specify-one , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36902497/cannot-install-cocoapods-no-podfile-found-in-the-project-directory )

# Immediate To-Do
1. Make new stacks of drawer tabs 
2. Add navigation to drawer tabs
3. Add a sign-in stack: ask for credentials
4. Add a register stack: credentials
5. Connect to a backend server (Firebase) - BIG ONE
6. Test for any bugs while signing in or registering
