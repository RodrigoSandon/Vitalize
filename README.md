# VitalizeProject
Master branch - pushed from origin

# Possible Bugs
1. Transition from non-Me tabs to logout (there's a unsmooth transition)
2. Configuring firebase backend: need to open project on Xcode to configure firebase but right now they are separate projects. Need to make .xcodeproj file match that of the Vitalize_App_Official file

# Immediate To-Do
1. Make new stacks of drawer tabs 
2. Add navigation to drawer tabs
3. Add a sign-in stack: ask for credentials
4. Add a register stack: credentials
5. Connect to a backend server (Firebase) - BIG ONE
6. Test for any bugs while signing in or registering
